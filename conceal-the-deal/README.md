CONCEAL THE DEAL

THEME: CYBERSECURITY 
Our Project deals with cipher-cryptography, We've written a new method to cipher our code: caeser-cipher cryptography is commonly known to all nowadays 
(using maven based springboot framework)

The Issue: CONCEAL THE DEAL solves

1) In the world of digital fraud, to prevent our data, many techniques are used to keep our data safe from hackers (or any third
party), One of them is Cryptography.
2) We use Cryptography to cipher our data (Focusing more on passwords) from any unauthorized third party.
3) Nowadays as hacking is very common and is a very big threat to our data.
4) Encryption ensures information is kept confidential. So, we use cryptography. The most common cryptography is Caesar Cipher.


How is CONCEAL THE DEAL different from Caeser Cipher? 

Since the (the shift three case) caesar cipher cryptography can easily be broken. 
So, there is a need of more secured cryptography which can secure  our confidential information.
So, we have developed a new Ciphering method which is more secured than the latter one. 
The User can decide himself how much he wants to shift the symbols and elements. 

In Conceal the dealâ€™s cipher, each alphabet in the message is replaced (by the number of shifts you tell it to) places down. 


Challenges we ran into
1) We faced an issue while building our project in the spring-boot framework while integrating the project.

2) After analyzing all the themes, we were searching for a different topic. Cybersecurity was our choice.
We did't have any idea about cryptography and Ciphering before. So, We studied all these things in 2-3 days and thus we spent our starting 10-12 hrs on studing, and then started building the project.

So, the major issue we face was TIME.


Technologies we used

1. Language-Java
2. Apache Maven
3. Springboot framework
4. Cipher-cryptography
5. IDE-IntelliJ


ABOUT OUR PROJECT:

This is a maven based spring boot application which expose the end point

Below end point can be used to create cesearciphor text

http://<server>:<port>/api/v1/shift

To run the program

mvn spring-boot:run

By default this will run on 7001
